### Interacting with Python on the Command Line

I want to show you another way to use Python, which is from the command line in something called interactive mode.

If this is your first time doing this, you might want to make sure that you're running Python 3.

`python --version`

If I had python 2, then I could create a new environment with python 3.  Or I might need to fix my installation.

`python`

If I type python, then a python interpreter starts up and I get a new prompt.

now, I can type some python statements.

`7+7`

`print("text")`

each time I do this, the statement gets sent to the python interpreter.  The interpreter executes the statement and the output gets displayed.

This can be useful for quick calculations.  We'll sometimes use this method for our course videos.
