    "\n",
    "1. Inheritance:\n",
    "    * No, this is just an example of an instance of the class MobileDevice or ServiceContract when created can be added to the add_to_cart.\n",
    "    * Inheritence are cases where subclasses can reuse the behavior from the parent class (ie inherited from)\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Polymorphism:\n",
    "    * No, this isnt a case of polymorphism as well. Polymorphism is a case best explained with the Class (Animal) and subclasses Dog and Cat -- both inhering a common method (talk) but return different values. So, when called, Cat and Dog objects will return 2 different values (asuming they are meow and woof!). I see polymorphism (in the sense of classes) as a special case of inheritence.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Object-Oriented programming:\n",
    "    * Yes. For sure this is case of OOP because both MobileDevice and ServiceContract are classes from which specific instances are created. These objects have methods which allow them to interact with other classes (like, Cart for example) which is the textbook definition of OOP\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Top-down design:\n",
    "    * this could be a case of bottom-up design where the problem space (ie shopping mobile devices and signing a service contrat) is the problem space which has been broken down into 3 large component. A typical characteristic of bottom-up deisgn is wehre the pieces are well known and some experimentation is necessary to assemble them into the whole\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Functional programming:\n",
    "    * No, this is not an example of functional programming, which by definition passing functions as parameters to other functions. In the above example, we are passing objects to functions of other class-objects. Moreover, the fn programming also involves  writing code that does not change state (ie multiple function will yield the same result) which is not the case here as each object is unique and different from the other"

I found **ClinVar** which is a repository that contains expert curated data, and it is free for the taking. This is a gold mine! Look at the file and tell me what gene and mutation combinations are classified as dangerous.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure that you only give your boss the dangerous mutations and include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Gene name\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Mutation ID number\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Mutation Position (chromosome & position)\n",

    "1) The deliverables are the final result as a dataframe with a short discussion of any specifics. (that is, what data you would present to your boss with the explanation of your results)\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Limit your output to the first 100 harmful mutations and tell your boss how many total harmful mutations were found in the file\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Use the instructor-modified \"clinvar_final.txt\" at this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Zps0YssoJbZHrn6iLte2RDLlgruhAX1s/view?usp=sharing This file was modified to be not exactly the same as 'standard' .vcf file to test your data parsing skills. **This is a large file so do NOT upload it into your github repo!**\n",

    "* We do not expect you to have any medical knowledge to solve this problem; look at the data, read the documentation provided, and write down your assumptions!\n",
    "\n",
    "* Correct pseudocode will give you partial credit so start with that. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Map out which fields you want to extract: Are they in the same place every time? What strategy will you use to robustly extract and filter your data of interest? How do you plan to handle missing data?\n",
    "\n",
    "* A good way to start is to print out each line, then practice parsing them to see if you can recover the fields of interest\n",
    "\n",
    "* A starting solution for parsing .vcfs can be found here: https://gist.github.com/dceoy/99d976a2c01e7f0ba1c813778f9db744 This solution does **NOT** work due to the changes we've made but can be modified to work. As with any solution that needs modifications, it may take less time to make your own solution!\n",

    "* Filter out junk and lines with no mutation data. Just focus on the data your need to deliver to your boss. \n",

    "* The unit of observation of this dataset is one row per mutation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* This is similar to a task that one of us tackled at work. You can answer the question with the information provided below or using the (partial) data dictionary file at this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lx9yHdlcqmU_OlHiTUXKC_LQDqYBypH_/view?usp=sharing. Our goal is to see that you can put together a sensible plan, implement a solid parsing strategy, and document and justify the decisions that you made."
