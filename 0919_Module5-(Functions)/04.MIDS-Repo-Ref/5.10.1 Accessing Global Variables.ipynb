    "We have seen how to pass objects into a function as arguments. This is the clearest, and safest, way to get values we need into a function, but Python does give us other ways. In the following code, notice the line `x = x + y` inside the function. x is a parameter, so we know x is a local variable. There is no local variable y, however. In this situation, Python will try to find a value for the variable y by looking up the stack. Since there is no y in the local namespace, Python checks in the global namespace. In this case, there is a global y, so Python uses this value. Run the code to confirm that the y's are the same."

    "Is it good to change global variables using the `global` keyword? Programmers have different opinions about this, but excessive use of the `global` keyword can make code unreadable and fragile. When we access global variables from inside a function, we break the basic model of how a function operates. One of the major benefits of functions is encapsulation; we expect a function to perform a specific task, and we would like to understand its effects by looking at its parameters and return value. When a function makes changes in other ways, it is harder to keep track of and can easily lead to programming errors.\n",
