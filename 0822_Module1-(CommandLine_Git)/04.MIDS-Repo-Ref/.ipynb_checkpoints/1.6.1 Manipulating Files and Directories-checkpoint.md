# Manipulating Files and Directories

I want to give you a few more bash commands that are useful for working with files and directories.  First, lets create a new folder that will hold my work.  I can use the mkdir command.  Notice that when I name things, I really don't want to use spaces, because then I'd also need to put the entire name in quotes.  Instead I use an underscore.

`mkdir demo`

`cd demo`

I can cd into the new directory, and then I can make a new blank file using the touch command.

`touch todo.txt`

To add a line of text to this file, I can use the echo command, with a redirection operator.

`echo "buy milk" >> todo.txt`

To see the contents of the file, I'll use the cat command.

`cat todo.txt`

Note that if you use a single carat, it will overwrite the file

`echo "practice coding" > todo.txt`

`cat todo.txt`

You need the double-carat if you want to append.

`echo "go for run" > todo.txt`

`cat todo.txt`

If I want to move this file, I can use the mv command.

`mv todo.txt ..`

`cd ..`

`ls`

It turns out that mv is also the command you need to rename a file

`mv todo.txt demo/todo_list.txt`

`cd demo`

`ls`

I can make a copy of the file using cp

`cp todo_list.txt todo2.txt`
`ls`

I really only want one todo list though, so I'll delete the copy

`rm todo2.txt`

I'll save the todo list to practice editing later.
