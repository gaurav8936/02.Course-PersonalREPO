# VIM

There are times when you need use the command line to edit a text file.  There are editors for this (VIM, Emacs, nano).  But they are archaic and don't have many features.  Most people would not want to use them to write a paper.  But sometimes a little bit of editing is necessary.  I'm going to show you an editor called VIM, because you're going to need it later when you learn git.

`vim todo_list.txt`

Now we're inside vim.  The first thing to know is that vim has different modes.
Now we're in command mode.  If you start typing, you won't get text on the screen, and you might make surprise changes to the document.

`dd`

For example, dd will delete a line of text.  
If you want to type text, you need to first enter insert mode

`i`

Now you can see INSERT at the bottom, so you know you can start typing.  Once you're done, you want to get back to command mode

`ESC`

We usually want to save now.

`:w`

And the most important command is how to quit.  That's because when you use git, a vim editor will sometimes pop up, and it's possible for beginners to panic because they don't know how to exit.

`:q`

Let's try one more time...

`vim todo_list.txt`

`i`

`win lottery`

`ESC`

If I try to quit without saving, it will give me a warning.  I can type :q! to quit without saving.  or :wq to save and quit at the same time.

`:wq`

And now my todo list is complete.
