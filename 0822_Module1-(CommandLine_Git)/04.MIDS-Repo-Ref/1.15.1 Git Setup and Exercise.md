# 1.15.1 Git Setup and Exercise

## First exercise with Git

Before proceeding, use the following instructions to set up your local assignment repository. This will be the place you work on your class assignments. You should have write access to your student repository, but it will be only readable by you and your instructors. When you complete your homework each week, you will use a push command to upload your work to this repository.

## Initial Setup

There are several ways that you can set up your local repository. We recommend the following procedure.

First create an empty repository in the I-School Github for your homework, you can do this through the github user interface.

### 1) Create a new repository

A. This is done through the green NEW button on the upper right and select "New repository":

![](D:\W200\Ischool\datasci-200-Course-Materials\week_01\images\CreateRepo_2.PNG)

B. Select Owner and the **UC-Berkeley-I-School** organization from the dropdown. This is an important step so that the instructors can view your repo!

C. Name your repo as: mids-datasci200-spring22-Firstname-LastnameREPO so mine is **"mids-datasci200-spring22-Robert-FosterREPO"**

D. Make the repository **private** with the radio button

- Important: Do not add a readme file you need an empty repository

E. Click Create repository

F. When you look at your repository it should look **LIKE THIS (this is an empty repo)**

# 2) Give the instructors read access

A. Click on Add Teams and collaborators on the top (shown in the picture above).

- Alternatively, in your new **private** repository, go to the **settings** tab, on the right and then select **Manage access** on the left

B. Click on **Add teams**

C. In the window that pops-up, type in the **datasci200_Instructors** team, give us **read** access and click **add**:

## 3) Clone your repo to your local computer

You need to tell git that you will be pushing modified content (completed homework) to YourNameREPO repository on github.

A. **You need to signup for Two Factor Authentication:** You cannot use a password to clone the repo - you need to setup a personal access token and use that as shown in this article: [https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token (Links to an external site.)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) 

-  If you would rather use an ssh key follow the steps here: [https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent (Links to an external site.)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)

B. On github.com navigate to your repo and the <> Code tab (upper left). The page should be back to this: 

![](D:\W200\Ischool\datasci-200-Course-Materials\week_01\images\CreateRepo_7.PNG)

C. Select either HTTPS (personal access token) or SSH (ssh key). Click on the paste button 

D. Open a command prompt and use it to navigate to your desktop or course working directory. Then execute the following commands:

*Note: lines preceded by "#" are comments to explain each step and should not be executed.*

```
# clone the assignment repository onto your computer

git clone <paste your repo name in here>

# Note: This will be an empty repository at the beginning of the course.

cd <your repo name?
```

E. To check if you did everything right, execute the following command:

```
git remote -v
```

- The output should show "fetch" and "push" to your repo named 'origin' (repo name may vary slightly from the image).

## 4) Completing the Exercise

For this exercise, you will post your first work to your personal repository. The Github repository **mids-datasci200-Course-Materials** contains the exercise.

A. Make a new folder called **"SUBMISSIONS"** in your local repo

- - Try using the **mkdir** command from within your local repo.

B. Now that you have your student repository set up on your computer *move out of it* (cd ..)

C. Clone the Course Materials repository to your local machine

```
cd ..
# For Personal Access Token:
git clone https://github.com/UC-Berkeley-I-School/mids-datasci200-Course-Materials.git (Links to an external site.)# For SSH:git clone git@github.com:UC-Berkeley-I-School/mids-datasci200-Course-Materials.git
```

D. In the **mids-datasci200-Course-Materials/week_01** folder copy the file named "First_GitHub_Exercise.txt" from your local **mids-datasci200-Course-Materials** repository to your local **student repo**/**SUBMISSIONS** folder. 

- **NOTE**: This is not the HW assignment for week_01 - that will be assigned after your first in-person session.
- To copy the file you can practice using the command line **cp** command or just drag and drop the file.

E. Open the "First_GitHub_Exercise.txt", answer the questions, and save.

F. To commit the changes to your local repository, go back to your command terminal, navigate to your student repo, and type the following.

```
git status
```

- This should confirm that you have a modified file in your repository. Go ahead and add the file.

```
git add SUBMISSIONS/

# check status to see that your file has been added as a new file (in green)

git status

# Then commit your changes.

git commit -m "completed GitHub exercise".
```

G. Pushing Changes to GitHub. Now it is time to push your changes up to your GitHub repository. Push your changes to the master branch of origin, representing your repository on GitHub.

```
git push origin master
```

Check the GitHub repository in your browser to confirm that your changes are there.

## 5) Recap on steps for pushing files to Github:

These are the three steps you will be using most of the time to push your assignment each week:

```
git add SUBMISSIONS/

git commit -m "Add a commit message here"

git push origin master
```

## 6) Merging

From time to time you may have to merge what files are on the website and your local drive when you **pull** in a version of the repository that are not the same. You may see a screen like the one below (Note: We are using an old 2016 repository in this example)

![](D:\W200\Ischool\datasci-200-Course-Materials\week_01\images\CreateRepo_9.png)

**This is VIM**, a command line text editor. You need to enter a short message overwriting one of the blue tilde and then write the message to file to do this:

1. Type **i** to enter the "insert" mode (look to the bottom of the screen for the word "INSERT")

2. Use arrow keys to navigate to the line above the blue tilde and type in a message (any explanation about one line long)

3. Exit the insert mode by pushing **Esc** ("INSERT" will disappear) then

4. Type **:wq** this means *"write then quit" you should see some sort of message indicating that the merge was successful as shown below.

5. **Side Note:** If you have not made any changes VIM will not want to quit and you can force it to quit without recording changes using **:q!**. *Since you are entering a merge note, this should not happen. However, it is good to note that VIM has a rich array of advanced commands*
