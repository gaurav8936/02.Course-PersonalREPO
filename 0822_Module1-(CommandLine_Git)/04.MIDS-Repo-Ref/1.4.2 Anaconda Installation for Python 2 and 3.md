# Anaconda setup instructions

What is Anaconda and why are we using it?

We are using the Anaconda distribution of python in order to smooth the process of installing python. There
are numerous conflicts that can occur across and within Python installations. Anaconda manages the
packages to avoid conflicts. It also automatically loads most of the common workhorse packages in one click
so you can get to coding. 

If your macOS already has python 2 installed, skip to the section ```Instructions to set up Anaconda with Python 2```

1. Download the Python 3 version from the Anaconda distribution page

```
If you are working on a Linux or MacOS machine, you can choose to download the command line or
graphical installer version.
Windows users should install the graphical package.
```
## With the graphical installer

```
The graphical package can be downloaded and the installer should walk you through the setup.
So that the anaconda components can be found, be sure to allow the Anaconda to:
"prepend the Anaconda3 install location to PATH"
(Be careful because this may not be the default)
```
## From the command line

```
The steps are the same for MacOSX and Linux.
Download the command line installer by clicking on the link, using curl, or using wget to download the
file for you. For example:
$ curl -O "https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2019.03-Linux-x86_64.sh"
```
Execute the installer

```
Change your directory (cd) to the folder with the file and run the installer
write "bash" even within the bash shell you should be able to locate the downloaded file in your local
folder or in the downloads folder
```
```
Be sure to allow the Anaconda to "prepend the Anaconda3 install location to PATH" so that the
anaconda components can be found
```
## Verify installation

```
Anaconda3-5.2.0-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
```
```
$ cd <directory-with-installer>
$ bash Anaconda3-5.2.0-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
```

```
Type 'python' at the command line and you should see a version of python 3 listed
$ python "Python 3.7.2 ..." # some version of python 3
Exit and run the jupyter notebook
exit () $ jupyter notebook
On the command line you should see:
```
```
Your browser should open with the Jupyter notebook
X out of the browser and hit ctrl - c to exit on the command line
```
# Install a virtual environment

```
If Python 2 opens instead of Python 3 or if the Jupyter notebook does not open, try creating a virtual
environment with Anaconda.
You can use virtual environments to run isolated version of python and its packages and avoid
incompatibilities.
```
Note: If you already have Anaconda and have python 2 installed you can make a new "virtual environment"
and specify python 3 during setup.

# Create a new virtual environment

```
(The name py3jp is arbitrary)
The virtual environment allows you to specify the python version python packages to be installed.
$ conda create -n py3jp python=3 jupyter matplotlib
To activate this virtual environment
$ source activate py3jp
Check the python version and Jupyter notebook shown above
$ python
exit() $ jupyter notebook As above X out of the browser and hit ctrl-c to exit in the command line
When you are done
$ source deactivate
```
```
"[I 13:30:37.290 NotebookApp] Saving file at.."
```
Your anaconda environment should be up and running. 
If Python 2 is installed on your macOS, follow the steps below to set up Anaconda. 

# Instructions to set up Anaconda with Python 2
Download the command line installer by using curl or using wget. For example:
```
$ curl -O "https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh"
```
Execute the installer
Change your directory (```cd```) to the folder with the file and run the installer
write "bash" even within the bash shell you should be able to locate the downloaded 
file in your local folder or in the downloads folder
```
$ bash ~/Downloads/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
```

Use the following command to check the shell you are currently in. 
```
$ echo $0
```
Type the command below to activate conda's base environment without modifying shell 
script, then plug in the username and replace ```zsh``` with the shell you are currently in.
```
$ eval "$(/Users/<username>/miniconda3/bin/conda shell.zsh hook)"
```
Activate conda's base environment on startup, type ```conda init```
To create a new virtual environment named py2, for instance:
```
$ conda create -n py2
```
To activate the environment:
```
$ conda activate py2
```
Install Jupyter notebook and other necessary packages in the virtual environment:
```
$ conda install jupyter matplotlib numpy pandas
```
Once the installation is complete, check the python version 
```
$ python
```
Enter ```exit()``` or ```ctrl+z``` to terminate the prompt. 
To launch jupyter notebook:
```
$ jupyter notebook
```
To list all the packages installed in the virtual environment
```
$ conda list
```
Once you are done, deactivate the environment
```
$ conda deactivate
```
