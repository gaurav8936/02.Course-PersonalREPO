### W200: Introduction to Data Science Programming 

### First Module

Up until this point we have used Jupyter notebooks to run python code. Normally when you put code into a production system it is done in .py files and modules. 

#### Making a .py file:

To make a .py file is fairly straightforward. I usually write/debug the code in a notebook and then copy and paste it over into a text or code editor. Today I'm using VSCode as my code editor but there are many out there and even text editors like notepad++ come with add-ins for python code syntax.

After I copy and paste the code in - I want to make sure that the spacing translated. Incorrect spacing is probably the primary issue with cut/pasting code as sometimes the standard tab/4 spaces from the notebook (or vice-versa) wont translate correctly.

Once the code looks right in the editor - I'll save this file as a .py

#### Running a Python file from the command line:

To run a Python file from the command line - I'll open up my anaconda prompt and navigate to the folder in which I saved the .py file. Then i can just type in:

`python my_file.py`

And it runs!
